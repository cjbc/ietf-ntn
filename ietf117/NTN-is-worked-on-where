The concept of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) is currently being
addressed, worked on, and defined at a few places.  The term probably
originated at ITU a few years ago.  Since then it was used extensively
at 3GPP.  Currently, I see the NTN term being the main focus at these
places:

- NWM at ETSI "SA2 Rel-19 23Q3 moderated discussion - Satellite
  Architecture Enhancements", need NWM ETSI account for it.  Deadline
  about end of July.  https://nwm-trial.etsi.org/#/documents/8525
  
- SSIG#62/28th July 2023 meeting: 1st draft of the Rel-19 NTN package
  proposal for discussion.  It is a group in the fringes of 3GPP.
  Feedback needed before July 27th.  Email.

- EU: NTN integral part in the current consultation about the work
  programme of year 2024 for EU SNS work programme (the future EU
  calls for projects related to 6G).  Consultation, about many other
  topics, incuding NTN, within the SNS partnership until about end of
  August.  See the private document draft-orientations-2024.pdf,
  accessible to SNS partners.

- EU: definition of the Work Programme 2025 of Cluster 4 of Horizon
  Europe, destination 'Space'.  Contact the National Contact Points in
  Europe.

- Europe and larger: ESA has many calls for projects ongoing about
  'NTN'.  See the ESA Star portal, keyword 'NTN'.

- many private company efforts to put 5G base stations at higher
  altitudes and space, an example is lynk.global but there are more.

- there is a particular relationship between Europe's IRISÂ²
  constellation project and NTN, although it is not clear whether they
  are equal.

- the ISOC's "Perspective on LEO Satellites" document was written
  about new Internet constellations, although it does not say 'NTN'.
  It is also possible that 'NTN' is not about constellations at all.
